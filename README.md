# Project README

## Overview

This project aims to create a robust employee management system using the Django framework. It includes functionalities for CRUD operations on employee records, pagination for listing employees, and integration with a relational database management system.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used as the primary programming language for backend development.
- **Django**: Chosen as the web framework for its built-in ORM, admin interface, and MVC architecture.
- **MySQL**: Selected as the database management system for its scalability and relational data model.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for frontend development to ensure responsive and modern UI design.
- **Faker**: Employed for generating fake data to populate the database during development and testing phases.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing and tracking changes to the project codebase.
- **GitHub**: Hosted repository for collaboration, version control, and issue tracking.
- **SQL Editor (e.g., MySQL WorkBench)**: Used for writing and executing SQL queries directly against the PostgreSQL database.
- **REST API**: Implemented using Django REST Framework to provide data interaction capabilities via APIs.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Used for frontend development and enhancing user interactivity.
- **Visual Studio Code**: IDEs utilized for code editing, debugging, and project management.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Python (version 3.11) and Django (version 5.0.2) are installed.
2. **Clone Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Arash7447/sayan-diba`
3. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Database Setup**: `python manage.py migrate`
5. **Run Development Server**: `python manage.py runserver`

## Usage

- Access the application via: `http://localhost:8000/`
- Perform CRUD operations on employees.
- Navigate through paginated employee lists.
- Use the admin interface for database management.

## Scripts and Customization

- **populate_employees.py**: Script to generate and populate the `employees` table with fake data.
- **Custom SQL queries**: Utilized for advanced database operations or optimizations.

## Testing

- Run tests: `python manage.py test`

## Additional Notes
